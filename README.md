# sfmlproject-tictactoe
cop 3003 - tic-tac-toe game
this is a 2 player tic-tac-toe game
this allows you to play tic-tac-toe with your friend
the reason why I made this game was because i need to make something for a class project and
tic-tac-toe has always been one of my favorite games to play 
it's a fun game that is quick to play easy to learn and a great pass time game
